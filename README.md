# Aim:
To perform content creation (e.g., reports, articles, case studies, comic books, etc.) using various prompt patterns with language models like ChatGPT.

# objective:
To demonstrate how different prompting techniques—such as query decomposition, decision-making chains, semantic filtering, role-based prompting, and iterative refinement—can significantly influence the quality, coherence, and structure of generated content.

# Algorithm/Methodology:

Prompt Design:
Formulate different types of prompts tailored for specific content formats (e.g., informative report vs. creative story).

Techniques Employed:

Query Decomposition: Breaking a complex prompt into smaller, manageable sub-prompts.

Decision-Making Chains: Creating prompts that simulate human decision logic.

Semantic Filtering: Applying constraints or rules to maintain relevance and tone.

Role-based Prompting: Asking the model to assume a specific persona or professional role.

Iterative Refinement: Revising outputs through follow-up prompts for clarity and improvement.

Content Creation:
Generate content across multiple formats using the above techniques.

Evaluation:
Assess the generated content based on clarity, coherence, relevance, creativity, and adherence to format.

# Result:
The corresponding prompt executed successfully, yielding coherent and structured content aligned with the intended output format.
